How to use the system day-to-day. These are the actual workflows you'll repeat
every week, month, quarter, and year.

## Your Daily Routine (5 minutes)

### 1. Check the Morning Briefing

If heartbeat is configured, it arrives automatically at 7 AM.
Otherwise, just ask: **"Morning briefing"**

What you're looking for:
- Any emergency maintenance? → Act immediately
- Any payments received overnight (bank notifications)? → Record them
- Any follow-ups due today? → Handle them
- Cash position still healthy? → If warning, plan ahead

### 2. Log Expenses as They Happen

Throughout the day, when you pay anything for the building:

> "Paid [vendor] [amount] for [what], from [account]"

Examples:
- "Paid EDENORTE 12,500 for electricity from the bank"
- "Paid 1,200 cash from petty cash to the plumber for lobby faucet"
- "Paid security guard salary 18,000 by transfer"
- "Bought cleaning supplies 3,500 cash"

The agent logs it, categorizes it, links it to the budget, and tracks it.

### 3. Record Payments When They Arrive

When an owner pays:

> "[Unit] paid [amount] by [method], ref [number]"

Examples:
- "A-3 paid 25,000 by bank transfer, ref 4521"
- "A-6 paid 35,000 cash today"
- "A-2 paid 10,000 by check #1234"

The agent records it, updates the balance, and optionally drafts a confirmation.

### 4. Handle Maintenance Requests

When something breaks or an owner reports an issue:

> "[Unit/location] has [problem]"

Examples:
- "A-4 has a water leak in their bathroom"
- "The pool pump isn't working"
- "The lobby needs repainting"
- "Generator won't start — emergency"

The agent creates the request, classifies priority, and suggests next steps.

## Your Weekly Routine (15 minutes, Monday)

### 1. Review the Weekly Summary

Ask: **"Weekly summary"**

Check:
- Net cash flow (positive or negative?)
- Collection rate (>95% is healthy)
- Open maintenance (anything aging?)
- Upcoming payments (vendor invoices due)

### 2. Follow Up on Overdue Payments

Ask: **"Who owes money?"**

For each overdue unit, decide:
- First time late? → "Draft friendly reminder for [unit]"
- 15+ days? → "Draft formal notice for [unit]"
- 30+ days? → "Draft warning for [unit]"
- 60+ days? → "Draft pre-legal notice for [unit]"

Review each draft, then send via email/WhatsApp.

### 3. Update Maintenance Status

Ask: **"Show all open maintenance"**

For each open request:
- Call contractor for update
- Update status: "Mark pool pump repair as completed, actual cost 15,000"
- Close resolved items: "Close the lobby light request"

### 4. Petty Cash Reconciliation

If you use petty cash, reconcile weekly:

> "How much should be in petty cash?"

Compare agent's calculated balance with actual cash on hand.
If discrepancy: "Adjust petty cash by -500, reason: unrecorded purchases"

---

## Your Monthly Routine (1 hour, 1st of month)

### 1. Generate Monthly Financial Report

Ask: **"Monthly financial report for [last month]"**

Review:
- Revenue vs expectations
- Expenses by category (any surprises?)
- Budget variance (anything >10% over?)
- Cash position trend (improving or declining?)

### 2. Update Cash Position

Verify bank balances match your records:

> "Update operating account balance to [actual balance per bank statement]"
> "Update petty cash to [actual count]"
> "Update reserve fund to [actual balance]"

### 3. Fee Cycle (Quarterly Months Only: Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)

If it's a quarter start:

> "Generate fee call for Q[X] [Year]"

Review the amounts, review each letter, then distribute to owners.

### 4. Send Payment Reminders

> "Generate reminders for all overdue units"

Review each one, adjust if needed, send.

### 5. File Receipts

Upload any physical receipts to the relevant Expense entry in Notion:
- Take photo → upload to the entry's "Receipt" field

### 6. Board/Owner Update (Optional)

If you send monthly updates:

> "Draft monthly owner update email"

---

## Your Quarterly Routine (2 hours)

### 1. Quarterly Financial Review

Ask: **"Full quarterly review"**

This gives you:
- 3-month income/expense comparison
- Budget vs actual (cumulative YTD)
- Reserve fund assessment
- Cash runway (how many months of expenses can current cash cover?)

### 2. Delinquency Deep Dive

Ask: **"Delinquency analysis with impact"**

This shows the full picture:
- Who owes what, and for how long
- What would the cash position be if they paid
- Legal status of each delinquent unit
- Recommended escalation actions

### 3. Vendor Review

Ask: **"Show all vendor expenses this quarter"**

Check:
- Any vendor charging significantly more?
- Contracts up for renewal?
- Quality issues to address?

### 4. Common Area Inspection

Walk the building with this checklist:

> "Generate quarterly inspection checklist"

Log any issues found as maintenance requests.

### 5. Insurance Review

Ask: **"When is the next insurance payment?"**

Verify coverage is adequate, especially if major works were completed.

## Your Annual Routine (AGM Season)

### Pre-AGM (2-3 weeks before)

1. **Close the Fiscal Year**:
   > "Close fiscal year [Year]. Approved expenses: [total from your records]"

2. **Generate AGM Package**:
   > "Prepare full AGM package for [Year]"
   
   This produces:
   - Annual financial report
   - Year-end owner statements (one per unit)
   - Maintenance summary
   - Proposed budget for next year
   - Delinquency status (anonymized)
   - Draft agenda
   - Proxy form

3. **Send Meeting Notice**:
   > "Draft AGM notice for [date], [location]"
   
   Include: agenda, proxy form, previous minutes, financial summary

### At the AGM

- Present the financial report (agent can format it for screen/projector)
- Vote on approving the accounts
- Vote on next year's budget
- Vote on any proposed works
- Record minutes

### Post-AGM

1. **Record Meeting**:
   > "Record AGM minutes: [details]"

2. **Update Budget**:
   > "Set [Year] approved budget to [amount]"

3. **Send Minutes**:
   > "Draft AGM minutes distribution email"

4. **Apply Closing Adjustments**:
   The year-end closing creates adjustment entries based on approved total

5. **Generate New Year Statements**:
   > "Generate definitive [Year] statements for all owners"

---

## Handling Common Situations

### "An owner is selling their unit"

1. Generate their current account statement
2. Calculate any outstanding balance
3. The buyer assumes the account balance (credit or debt)
4. Update Units Registry with new owner details
5. Send welcome letter to new owner

> "Generate sale statement for [unit]"
> "Update [unit] owner to [new name], email [email]"

### "A tenant is moving in/out"

> "Update A-3: new tenant [name], email [email], lease [start] to [end]"
> "Clear tenant from A-5 — unit is now vacant"

### "Emergency at 2 AM"

Message your agent even at 2 AM:

> "Emergency: water pipe burst in A-2, flooding the lobby"

The agent creates an emergency maintenance request and gives you:
- Emergency plumber contact from memory
- Steps to take (shut off water, document damage)
- Draft emergency notice to affected owners

### "Owner wants to see their account"

> "Generate full account statement for [unit], [year]"

Produces a detailed debit/credit ledger they can review.

### "The numbers don't add up"

> "Audit the finances — something seems off"

The agent cross-checks:
- Sum of all owner balances vs. total expected
- Sum of all expenses vs. budget tracking
- Bank balance vs. calculated balance
- Petty cash reconciliation

## Tips from Experience

1. **Log expenses immediately.** Don't let them pile up. It takes 10 seconds via chat.

2. **Record payments the same day.** When you see the bank notification, record it. Don't wait.

3. **Send fee calls on Day 1 of the quarter.** Consistency trains owners to expect and prepare.

4. **Follow up on Day 15, not Day 30.** The earlier you catch a late payment, the easier it is to resolve.

5. **Always draft, never auto-send.** Review every communication before it goes out. The AI drafts, you approve.

6. **Keep receipts in Notion.** Photo → upload. Future you (and auditors) will thank you.

7. **Run the monthly report even when things are fine.** It takes 2 minutes and builds a history of healthy operations.

8. **Use the audit function when something feels off.** Trust your instinct — if the cash seems low, ask the AI to check.

9. **Anonymize delinquent units in group communications.** Use "Unit X" not owner names. It's more professional and avoids legal issues.

10. **Back up your Notion workspace.** Export periodically. Your financial records are your legal protection.
