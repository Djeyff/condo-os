## 🗣️ VOICEOVER SCRIPT (Clean, Copy-Paste)

### 60s Version
```
If you're managing a condo with spreadsheets... I feel your pain.

Owner texts at 9pm: "What's my balance?"
Board meeting: "Where did the money go?"
You: opens four spreadsheets.

I built Condo Manager OS. One command. Eleven databases. Everything connected.

Dashboard? One command. Quarterly fees? One command. Who owes what? One command.
Trilingual statements — Spanish, English, French.

Owners check their own balance on Telegram. No more door knocks.

Live dashboards refresh automatically from your data.

Built by a property manager. For property managers.
Free template in the link. Full OS at condo-os dot com.
```

### 3min Version
```
I manage a seven-unit condo in the Caribbean. For years I used Excel.
Then I built this.

The problem with condo management software? Buildium starts at 62 dollars a month.
AppFolio won't touch you under 50 units. Condo Control wants a custom quote
that starts at 200 a month.

For a small building? That's insane.

So I built Condo Manager OS. One setup command creates eleven interconnected databases.
Relations, formulas, rollups — all auto-wired.

Every database is linked. Click an owner, see their balance, payments, maintenance.
Click an expense, see which budget line, which bank account paid for it.

Fee calls — one command charges every unit by ownership share.
Payments — record them, balance updates automatically.
Statements — professional, in three languages.
Delinquency — color-coded aging shows exactly who owes what.

And the best part? Owners open Telegram, check their own balance,
submit maintenance requests. No more nine PM door knocks.

Five live dashboards auto-refresh with your real data.
KPIs, financial health, delinquency tracker, maintenance board.

This runs on Notion. No monthly fees. No vendor lock-in. Your data stays yours.

Free template in the description. Full OS at the link.
Built by a property manager who was tired of spreadsheets.
```
