<div class="post-body" id="r1b">I manage a 7-unit condo in the Dominican Republic. Like many of you, I was stuck between:

- Paying $62-400/month for Buildium or Condo Control (insane for 7 units)
- Managing everything in spreadsheets (error-prone, no transparency)
- Doing everything manually via WhatsApp groups

So I built Condo Manager OS — a system that runs entirely on Notion (free tier works) with 11 connected databases:

- Owner Ledger with running balances
- Fee call generation and payment tracking  
- Maintenance request system with ticket numbers
- Voting & resolutions with auto-calculated quorum
- Budget tracking with category breakdowns
- Cash position monitoring across accounts

There's also an optional web portal where owners can check their balance, view statements, and submit maintenance requests.

The Notion template is $79 one-time (no monthly fees). The code is open-source on GitHub.

<div class="post-title" id="r2t">I built an 11-database Condo/HOA Management system in Notion — here's what I learned</div>
<div class="post-body" id="r2b">After months of building, I'm sharing my Condo Manager OS — an 11-database system for managing residential condominiums.

What's inside:
- 🏠 Units Registry (owners, shares, contact info)
- 💰 Owner Ledger (debits, credits, running balance via formulas)
- 📋 Budget (line items with category tracking)
- 💸 Expenses (linked to budget lines and cash accounts)
- 🔧 Maintenance (ticket system with priorities)
- 🏗️ Works & Projects (contractor tracking)
- 🏦 Cash Position (multi-account balances)
- 📅 Meetings (with linked resolutions)
- 🗳️ Resolutions & Votes (per-unit voting with ownership-weighted formulas!)
- 📨 Communications Log
- 💳 Account Movements

The cool part: everything is connected with relations, rollups, and formulas. The voting system auto-calculates quorum based on ownership shares — each unit's vote is weighted by their % of the building.

I also built a Next.js web portal on top (owners can log in and see their balance/statements) and a CLI tool with 17 commands.

**Bot:** Telegram bot for owner self-service (grammY)
**CLI:** Node.js, 17 commands (fee-call, payment, delinquency, vote, export, etc.)
**Automations:** 7 workflows (payment notifications, overdue alerts, meeting reminders)
**AI:** Optional OpenClaw integration for natural-language management

Total running cost: ~$1/month for AI tokens (optional). Everything else is free tier.

I ended up building my own system on Notion. It handles:

- Quarterly fee calls (auto-generated based on ownership shares)
- Payment tracking with running balances per owner
- Delinquency reports (color-coded, aging buckets)
- Maintenance requests (owners submit via web portal or Telegram)
- Annual budget with expense tracking
- General assembly voting (quorum auto-calculated)
- Financial reports and exports

Cost: $79 one-time for the template. No monthly fees. The optional AI assistant costs about $1/month.

<div class="post-title" id="r5t">I turned my condo management frustration into a product — $79 Notion template replacing $744/yr SaaS</div>
<div class="post-body" id="r5b">**The problem:** I manage a 7-unit condo. Buildium wants $744/year. For 7 units. That's $106 per unit per year just for software.

**What I built:** Condo Manager OS — 11 connected Notion databases with a Next.js web portal, Telegram bot, and CLI tool.

**The stack:**
- Notion (backend/databases) — free
- Next.js 14 + Tailwind (owner portal) — free on Vercel
- Node.js CLI (17 commands)
- Telegram bot (owner self-service)
- OpenClaw AI assistant (optional, ~$1/mo)

**The business model:**
- $79: Notion template only
- $149: Full kit (template + CLI + portal + bot + automations)
- $299: Done-for-you setup with video call

**Market insight:** There are ZERO condo/HOA management templates on Notion. Every property template I found is for landlords/investors, not shared-ownership associations. This is genuinely a new category.

**Stats:** 370K HOA associations in the US, 30-40% self-managed. If I capture 0.1% of the self-managed market... that's decent side income.

<div class="post">
<div class="post-label">LinkedIn #1 — Launch announcement</div>
<div class="post-body" id="li1">🏢 I just launched Condo Manager OS — and I'm excited to share why.

Managing a small condo association shouldn't require enterprise software.

Buildium charges $62-400/month. Condo Control starts at $200/month. For a 7-unit building, that math doesn't work.

So I built an alternative:
→ 11 connected Notion databases
→ Web portal for owners (balance, statements, maintenance)
→ CLI with 17 management commands
→ Voting system with weighted quorum
→ AI assistant for natural-language management

One-time cost: $79 for the template. No monthly fees.

5-year savings vs Buildium: $3,600+.

The code is open-source, the demo is live, and I'm looking for early adopters who manage small to medium condos.

<div class="post">
<div class="post-label">LinkedIn #2 — Cost savings story</div>
<div class="post-body" id="li2">💰 The hidden tax on small condo associations:

A 7-unit building paying for Buildium spends $744/year on management software.

Over 5 years, that's $3,720 — paid by owners through their fees.

For context, that's enough to:
• Repaint the entire lobby
• Replace a water heater
• Fund 6 months of landscaping

I built Condo Manager OS as a one-time $79 alternative. Same features (fee tracking, maintenance, voting, reports), runs on Notion, includes a web portal for owners.

The question every HOA board should ask: "Are we paying monthly for something we could own?"

<div class="post-label">LinkedIn #3 — Open source philosophy</div>
<div class="post-body" id="li3">🔓 Why I open-sourced my condo management system:

Condo associations are non-profit entities run by volunteers. Charging them $200-800/month for software feels wrong.

So I put the entire system on GitHub:
→ 17 CLI commands
→ Next.js owner portal
→ Telegram bot
→ 7 automation workflows
→ Excel import tool

The Notion template is $79 (someone has to pay for development time). But the code? Free forever.

If you're technical and want to set it up yourself: go ahead.
If you want the polished package with support: that's what the $79-149 is for.

I believe property management software should be accessible to every building, not just the ones that can afford enterprise SaaS.

I built Condo Manager OS because I manage a 7-unit condo in the Dominican Republic, and the existing software options were either way too expensive (Buildium at $744/yr) or way too basic (spreadsheets).

After months of building, I ended up with something I'm genuinely proud of:

→ 11 connected Notion databases (ledger, budget, maintenance, voting, etc.)
→ A Next.js web portal where owners can check their balance and submit requests
→ A Telegram bot for owner self-service
→ A CLI tool with 17 commands
→ An optional AI assistant that costs ~$1/month

The Notion template is $79 one-time. No monthly fees, no per-unit charges. The code is open-source on GitHub.

I'd love your feedback — especially from anyone who's been on an HOA board or managed a building. What features would you add?
